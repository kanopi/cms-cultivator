# Security Compliance Report

Generate a comprehensive, executive-friendly security report suitable for stakeholders, compliance audits, and management review.

## Report Structure

The report should provide both technical details and business context, suitable for different audiences:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview for non-technical stakeholders
2. **Security Posture** - Current state assessment
3. **Vulnerability Summary** - Issues found by severity
4. **Compliance Status** - Standards and regulations
5. **Risk Assessment** - Business impact analysis
6. **Remediation Plan** - Action items with timeline
7. **Recommendations** - Strategic improvements
8. **Appendices** - Technical details

## Report Generation Process

### 1. Gather Security Data

Run comprehensive security analysis:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerabilities
composer audit > reports/composer-audit.txt
npm audit --json > reports/npm-audit.json

# Code security scanning
phpcs --standard=Security web/modules/custom/ > reports/phpcs-security.txt

# Secret scanning
gitleaks detect --report-format json --report-path reports/secrets.json

# File permissions
find web/ -type f -perm -002 > reports/writable-files.txt

# User permissions (Drupal)
drush security:review --format=json > reports/drupal-security.json

# User permissions (WordPress)
wp user list --role=administrator --format=json > reports/wp-admins.json
```

### 2. Analyze Security Findings

Categorize and prioritize all findings:

**By Severity:**
- Critical: Immediate action required (RCE, SQLi, exposed credentials)
- High: Action required within 1 week (XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation)
- Medium: Action required within 1 month (information disclosure, misconfigurations)
- Low: Address when convenient (hardening opportunities)

**By Category:**
- Dependencies (vulnerable packages)
- Code vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Configuration issues (permissions, settings)
- Access control (user roles, file permissions)
- Secrets management (exposed credentials)
- Infrastructure (server configuration)

### 3. Assess Business Impact

For each finding, evaluate:

**Likelihood:**
- High: Easily exploitable, publicly known
- Medium: Requires some skill/knowledge
- Low: Difficult to exploit, requires insider access

**Impact:**
- Critical: Data breach, complete system compromise
- High: Significant data loss, service disruption
- Medium: Limited data exposure, partial service impact
- Low: Minimal impact, mostly theoretical

**Risk Score** = Likelihood √ó Impact

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Critical Vulnerabilities (2)

#### 1.1 SQL Injection in Custom Module

**Severity**: Critical (CVSS 9.8)
**Category**: Code Vulnerability
**Location**: `web/modules/custom/mymodule/src/Controller/MyController.php:45`
**Status**: üî¥ Open

**Description**:
User input is directly interpolated into SQL query without sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Technical Details**:
```php
// Vulnerable code
$uid = \Drupal::request()->query->get('uid');
$query = \Drupal::database()->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE uid = " . $uid);
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
An attacker could craft a URL like:
```
/mymodule/users?uid=1 OR 1=1
```
This would return all users, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Business Impact**:
- **Likelihood**: High (easily exploitable, no authentication required)
- **Impact**: Critical (complete database compromise, data breach)
- **Risk Score**: 9.8/10
- **Potential Loss**: $50,000 - $500,000 (breach response, fines, reputation)
- **GDPR Violation**: Yes (Article 32 - Security of Processing)

**Remediation**:
```php
// Fixed code
$uid = \Drupal::request()->query->get('uid');
$query = \Drupal::database()->query(
  "SELECT * FROM {users} WHERE uid = :uid",
  [':uid' => $uid]
);
```

**Timeline**:
- **Discovery**: [Date]
- **Fix Required By**: [Date] (48 hours)
- **Estimated Effort**: 2 hours
- **Testing Required**: 4 hours
- **Deployment**: [Date]

**Verification**:
- [ ] Code fix implemented
- [ ] Security test passed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] Logs reviewed for exploitation attempts

#### 1.2 Production Database Credentials Exposed in Git History

**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Secrets Management
**Location**: `.env` file (removed but in git history)
**Status**: üî¥ Open

**Description**:
Production database credentials were committed to git repository 3 months ago. While the file has been removed, credentials remain in git history and may have been exposed.

**Technical Details**:
```bash
# Found in commit abc123 (3 months ago)
DB_HOST=production.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_USER=prod_user
DB_PASSWORD=SuperSecretProd123!
```

**Exploitation Scenario**:
Anyone with repository access (past or present) could extract credentials from git history and gain unauthorized database access.

**Business Impact**:
- **Likelihood**: High (credentials still valid, history accessible)
- **Impact**: Critical (full database access, data breach)
- **Risk Score**: 9.5/10
- **Potential Loss**: $100,000 - $1,000,000 (GDPR fines, breach costs)
- **GDPR Violation**: Yes (Article 32 - Security of Processing)
- **Compliance**: PCI-DSS violation if storing payment data

**Remediation**:
1. Immediately rotate database credentials
2. Update all production systems with new credentials
3. Clean git history (coordinate with team):
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths
   git push --force --all
   ```
4. Review database logs for unauthorized access (past 3 months)
5. Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent future commits
