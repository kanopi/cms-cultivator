I'll use the **testing specialist** agent to analyze test coverage and identify gaps.

The testing specialist will:
1. **Analyze existing tests** - Review PHPUnit, Jest, Cypress tests
2. **Identify untested code** - Functions, classes, branches without coverage
3. **Calculate coverage metrics** - Line coverage, branch coverage, function coverage
4. **Prioritize testing gaps** - Critical paths, security-sensitive code, public APIs
5. **Generate test recommendations** - Specific tests needed for uncovered code

**Coverage types**: `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `critical-paths`

## Agent Used

**testing-specialist** - Coverage analysis specialist with gap identification and test recommendation capabilities.
