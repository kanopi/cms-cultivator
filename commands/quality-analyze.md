I'll use the **code-quality specialist** agent to analyze code quality and technical debt.

The code-quality specialist will:
1. **Analyze code complexity** - Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity
2. **Assess technical debt** - Code smells, anti-patterns, refactoring needs
3. **Review design patterns** - SOLID principles, DRY, separation of concerns
4. **Check maintainability** - Code readability, documentation, naming conventions
5. **CMS-specific patterns**:
   - **Drupal**: Drupal coding standards, dependency injection, render arrays
   - **WordPress**: WordPress coding standards, hooks over direct calls, security practices

**Focus areas**: `complexity`, `debt`, `patterns`, `maintainability`, `standards`

## Agent Used

**code-quality-specialist** - Code quality and technical debt analyst with CMS-specific standards knowledge.
