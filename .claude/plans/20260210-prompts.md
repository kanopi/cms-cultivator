Fetch the https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills repository.  This repo is a package that adds skills to LLMs.  Could we require this package as part of this claude code plugin and have the skills installed along side of our skills automatically


---

Response:

Based on my research, here's what I found:

Current Situation

Good news: Both projects are GPL-2.0-or-later licensed, so they're compatible!

Challenge: Claude Code does not currently support plugin dependencies. There's an
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9444 for this, but it's not yet implemented.

Integration Options

Option 1: Setup Command (Recommended)

Create a /setup-wordpress-skills command that automates the installation:

/setup-wordpress-skills

This would:
1. Clone the WordPress agent-skills repository to a temp location
2. Run their build script (node shared/scripts/skillpack-build.mjs --clean)
3. Run their install script (node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global)
4. Skills get installed to ~/.claude/skills/ where Claude Code discovers them
5. Report which WordPress skills are now available

Benefits:
- One command to set everything up
- WordPress skills stay updated via their repo
- Clear separation: CMS Cultivator plugin skills + WordPress global skills
- Users can update WordPress skills independently

Option 2: Git Submodule + Custom Installer

Add WordPress agent-skills as a git submodule and create our own install script:

git submodule add https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills.git vendor/wordpress-agent-skills

Then create /install-wordpress-skills that runs the build/install from the submodule.

Benefits:
- Version pinning (control which version gets installed)
- Included in plugin repo

Drawbacks:
- More maintenance burden
- Submodules can be tricky for users

Option 3: Documentation Only

Simply document in our README/docs that users can optionally install WordPress agent-skills:

## Optional: WordPress Agent Skills

For enhanced WordPress development, install the official WordPress agent-skills:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/agent-skills.git
cd agent-skills
node shared/scripts/skillpack-build.mjs --clean
node shared/scripts/skillpack-install.mjs --global
\`\`\`

These skills work alongside CMS Cultivator and provide deep WordPress expertise.

Benefits:
- Zero maintenance
- Users choose if they want it
- No complexity added to our plugin

Drawbacks:
- Manual process for users
- Skills might get out of sync

My Recommendation

Go with Option 1 (Setup Command). Here's why:

1. User-friendly: One command installs everything
2. Maintains separation: WordPress skills go to ~/.claude/skills/, ours stay in plugin
3. Stays current: Users pull latest WordPress skills anytime
4. Optional: Users can skip if they don't need WordPress-specific features
5. Compatible: When Claude Code adds dependency support, we can migrate easily

Would you like me to implement the /setup-wordpress-skills command? I can create it with:
- Pre-flight checks (Node.js installed, git available)
- Progress reporting
- Error handling
- Verification that skills were installed successfully
- List of available WordPress skills after installation

Create a plan to implement option 1.

---

I have renamed the plan to .claude/plans/20260210-add-setup-wordpress-skills.md

Lets rename the command to /wp-add-skills. Please update the plan only, than then stop.

---

Read the implementation plan at .claude/plans/20260210-add-setup-wordpress-skills.md and implement it completely.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use beads to track all implementation tasks - create issues for each major section of the plan before starting
2. Mark issues as you complete them
3. Follow the plan exactly as written - do not skip steps or take shortcuts
4. Complete ALL items in the plan including:
   - Creating the command file
   - Updating tests
   - Updating plugin metadata
   - Creating and updating all documentation files
   - Running tests to verify
5. After completing each section, mark the corresponding beads issue as done
6. When all implementation is complete, run the test suite to verify everything works
7. Provide a final summary of what was completed

Create the beads issues first, then implement systematically through each one.
