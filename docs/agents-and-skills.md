# Agents and Skills

CMS Cultivator features a three-tier architecture:

1. **Specialist Agents** - Orchestrate complex workflows (spawned by commands)
2. **Slash Commands** - User-facing interfaces (you invoke explicitly)
3. **Agent Skills** - Knowledge base (Claude invokes automatically during conversation)

---

## Specialist Agents

Agents are specialized AI assistants that handle complex, multi-step workflows. When you run a command, it spawns the appropriate agent to coordinate the work.

### Agent Architecture

**Leaf Specialists** (work independently):

- **accessibility-specialist** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance audits
- **performance-specialist** - Core Web Vitals and optimization analysis
- **security-specialist** - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
- **documentation-specialist** - API docs, guides, and changelogs
- **code-quality-specialist** - Code standards and technical debt assessment
- **structured-data-specialist** - JSON-LD/Schema.org auditing for SEO and AI discoverability

**Orchestrators** (delegate to other agents):

- **workflow-specialist** - PR workflows (delegates to testing, security, accessibility)
- **live-audit-specialist** - Comprehensive site audits (delegates to performance, accessibility, security, code-quality)
- **testing-specialist** - Test generation and coverage (delegates to security, accessibility)

### How Agents Work

```
/pr-create PROJ-123
    ↓
Spawns workflow-specialist
    ↓
    ├─→ Analyzes git changes
    ├─→ Generates commit message (uses commit-message-generator skill)
    ├─→ Spawns testing-specialist (if tests changed)
    │   └─→ May spawn security-specialist (for security tests)
    ├─→ Spawns security-specialist (if security-critical code)
    ├─→ Spawns accessibility-specialist (if UI changes)
    ↓
Compiles all findings into PR description
    ↓
Creates PR via GitHub CLI
```

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### Parallel Execution

The **live-audit-specialist** spawns all 4 leaf specialists simultaneously:

```
/audit-live-site https://example.com
    ↓
Spawns live-audit-specialist
    ↓
Spawns ALL in parallel:
    ├─→ performance-specialist (Core Web Vitals)
    ├─→ accessibility-specialist (WCAG compliance)
    ├─→ security-specialist (vulnerability scan)
    └─→ code-quality-specialist (technical debt)
    ↓
Waits for all results
    ↓
Synthesizes unified report:
    - Executive summary
    - Critical issues
    - Prioritized remediation roadmap
```

#### Conditional Delegation

The **workflow-specialist** intelligently delegates based on code changes:

```
PR with UI changes:
  → Spawns accessibility-specialist

PR with authentication code:
  → Spawns security-specialist

PR with new features:
  → Spawns testing-specialist
      → May spawn security-specialist (if security tests needed)
      → May spawn accessibility-specialist (if UI tests needed)
```

### Agent-to-Command Mapping

| Agent | Used By Commands | Can Delegate To |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| workflow-specialist | `/pr-commit-msg`, `/pr-create`, `/pr-review`, `/pr-release` | testing, security, accessibility |
| accessibility-specialist | `/audit-a11y` | (none - leaf) |
| performance-specialist | `/audit-perf` | (none - leaf) |
| security-specialist | `/audit-security` | (none - leaf) |
| testing-specialist | `/test-generate`, `/test-plan`, `/test-coverage` | security, accessibility |
| documentation-specialist | `/docs-generate` | (none - leaf) |
| live-audit-specialist | `/audit-live-site` | performance, accessibility, security, code-quality |
| code-quality-specialist | `/quality-analyze`, `/quality-standards` | (none - leaf) |
| structured-data-specialist | `/audit-structured-data` | (none - leaf) |

### Agent-to-Skill Mapping

Each agent uses specific skills for detailed "how-to" knowledge:

| Agent | Uses Skills |
|-------|-------------|
| workflow-specialist | commit-message-generator |
| accessibility-specialist | accessibility-checker |
| performance-specialist | performance-analyzer |
| security-specialist | security-scanner |
| testing-specialist | test-scaffolding, test-plan-generator, coverage-analyzer |
| documentation-specialist | documentation-generator |
| code-quality-specialist | code-standards-checker |
| structured-data-specialist | structured-data-analyzer |
| live-audit-specialist | (none - pure orchestrator) |

## Agent Skills

Agent Skills are **model-invoked** capabilities—Claude decides when to use them based on your conversation context, without you needing to remember specific command names.

### Three-Tier System Explained

| Feature | Slash Commands | Specialist Agents | Agent Skills |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Invocation** | User types `/command` | Commands spawn agents | Claude activates automatically |
| **Use Case** | User-facing interface | Multi-step orchestration | Conversational assistance |
| **Execution** | Spawns an agent | Coordinates workflow | Provides knowledge |
| **Example** | `/pr-create PROJ-123` | workflow-specialist orchestrates PR creation | "I need to commit my changes" |

## How to Use Agent Skills

### Natural Conversation

Simply talk to Claude naturally—the skills activate automatically:

```
✅ "I need to commit my changes"
✅ "Is this code accessible?"
✅ "How do I test this function?"
✅ "This query is slow"
✅ "Does this follow Drupal standards?"
```

No need to remember command names or syntax!

### When to Use Slash Commands Instead

Use explicit slash commands when you want:

**Full comprehensive analysis:**
- `/audit-a11y` - Complete WCAG audit (not just one element)
- `/audit-perf` - Full performance analysis with Lighthouse
- `/audit-security` - Complete OWASP Top 10 scan

**Structured workflows:**
- `/pr-create` - Create PR with full description
- `/pr-review 123` - Review specific PR
- `/pr-release` - Generate changelog and deployment notes

**Batch operations:**
- `/test-generate` - Generate tests for entire module
- `/docs-generate api` - Generate all API documentation

## Skill Activation Tips

### Be Specific About Context

**Less effective:**
```
"Check this code"
```

**More effective:**
```
"Is this button accessible?" → Triggers accessibility-checker
"Is this query secure?" → Triggers security-scanner
"Does this follow standards?" → Triggers code-standards-checker
```

### Show Relevant Code

Skills work best when you show the code you're asking about:

```
"Here's my UserManager class:
[paste code]

I need tests for this."

→ Triggers test-scaffolding skill
```

### Use Natural Language

Don't try to "game" the system—just describe what you need:

```
✅ "I fixed the bug and I'm ready to commit"
❌ "Use commit-message-generator skill"
```

## Skills Reference Table

| Skill | Triggers On | Best For | Related Command |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| commit-message-generator | "commit", "staged" | Quick commits | `/pr-commit-msg` |
| code-standards-checker | "standards", "style" | Code review | `/quality-standards` |
| test-scaffolding | "need tests", "how to test" | Single class tests | `/test-generate` |
| documentation-generator | "document", "API docs" | Quick docblocks | `/docs-generate` |

### Before Committing
- **staged changes** → commit-message-generator creates message
- **is code tested?** → coverage-analyzer checks gaps

### Before PR
- **accessibility check** → accessibility-checker validates
- **security check** → security-scanner finds vulnerabilities
- **performance check** → performance-analyzer identifies issues

### During Code Review
- All skills available for reviewers to validate code

## Disabling Skills (If Needed)

Agent Skills are project-level by default. To disable:

**For current session:**
```bash
# Skills are in .claude/skills/ for team collaboration
# Or ~/.claude/skills/ for personal use
```

**To prevent auto-activation:**
Simply use explicit slash commands instead—Claude will respect your explicit command choice.
